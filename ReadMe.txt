These are the assignments that was done as a part of Computer Vision Course last sem.
The reports are attached in every folder giving a brief description of the project. All codes are in Matlab.


1. EdgeDetection_HybridImgs-This project involves forming Hybrid Images and the implementation of Canny Edge Detection without inbuilt function.
2. EpiPolarGeometry_Metrology_StructureFromMotion- This project is about finding the height of building from single view metrology, Predicting the motion of keypoints using optical flow
3.DescrptorMatching_KeyPointTracking_objectInstanceRecognition- This project involves keypoint tracking, Shape alignment of one with another given two images and object instance recognition
4.SLIC_GraphCutSegmentation_EMAlgorithm- This project involves implementation of SLIC and Grab Cut algorithms for segmentation and implementing EM algorithm for finding mean scores of annotated images.
5.SceneCategoryRecognition_BagOfWords_differentClassifiers- This project involves outdoor category classification using Bag of Word Model and SVM, KNN classifiers.
